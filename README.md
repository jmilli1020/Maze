# Maze
##Built With -Unity

#Description
Fun little project I'm using to learn Unity.In the weeks to come I intend to continually develop this application in a "Tower Ascension/Dungeon Crawler" direction. A few pieces of functionality I would like to gradually add.
- An end to the maze that displays A success message on the users screen
- Replace the sphere "character" with an actual character model
- Equipment slots for character
- Items in the maze that can be picked up by player
- Add doors that require keys
- Add enemies
