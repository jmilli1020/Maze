# Maze
Fun little project I'm using to learn Unity.

In the weeks to come I intend to continually develop this application in a "Tower Ascension/Dungeon Crawler" direction.

A few pieces of functionality I would like to gradually add.
 -An end to the maze that displays A success message on the users screen
 -Replace the sphere "character" with an actual character model
 -Equipment slots for character
 -items in the maze that can be picked up by player
 -Add doors that require keys
 -Add enemies
